# Roomwave
Advanced reservation system enabling customers to book building hall spaces and managers to efficiently manage reservations. 


## Introduction


"Roomwave" is a project focusing on the analysis and design of a simplified room reservation management system. It involves system users, who are employees of a company, submitting reservation requests for meetings or events, and administrators responsible for approving those requests. Leveraging HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP for the backend, this project integrates front-end and back-end technologies to create a comprehensive solution for efficient room reservation management.

## Installation


For the implementation of the project, we utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with the jQuery library) for the frontend, and PHP and JSON for the backend. The system is hosted on an Apache server, and we employed XAMPP as the control panel. The browser used during development was Firefox.

Installation instructions:

1. Install XAMPP Control Panel.
2. Locate the "htdocs" subfolder within the XAMPP installation directory and place the project deliverable inside it.
3. Start the Apache server from XAMPP and click "admin" to open the server in the Firefox browser.
4. Modify the address http://localhost/dashboard as follows: http://localhost/Roomwave/user_login.html if you wish to log in as a user, or http://localhost/Roomwave/admin.html if you prefer to log in as an admin.
5. Assume that both users and admins have registered on the platform, and their credentials are stored in JSON format at the path: http://localhost/Roomwave/php/users/users.json.
